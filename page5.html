<p style="flex: 1; font-size: 25px; line-height: 1.6;">The Montessori method is an educational approach that emphasizes
hands-on learning and independence. It encourages children to exploreand discover at their own pace, fostering a love 
for learning from an early age. Classrooms are designed to be student-centered, with materials that promote practical 
life skills, problem-solving, and creativity. Teachers act as guides, observing and supporting each child's individual 
development rather than dictating every activity. Overall, the Montessori way nurtures both academic growth and personal 
responsibility preparing students to become confident, curious, and capable individuals.

<img src="OBMM.webp" alt="School Building" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 500px; height: auto;">

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;">Operation Brotherhood Montessori Center (OBMC) began in 1966 in Manila when 
Dr. Preciosa S. Soliven, supported by the humanitarian organization Operation Brotherhood International, opened the first
Montessori school using the educational principles developed by Dr. Maria Montessori. OBMC grew from a small children's 
house to a full school system with multiple campuses across Luzon, including Greenhills, Sta. Ana, Angeles City, Las Piñas, 
and Fairview. The school introduced Montessori education to the Philippines, emphasizing independence, hands on learning,
and respect for each child's development, true to Dr. Montessori's original philosophy. Over the years, OBMC expanded its 
programs to include preschool through senior high school and pioneered professional high school education grounded in 
Montessori ideals. Today, OBMC is recognized for its long tradition of nurturing curiosity, creativity, and lifelong 
learning in Filipino students.
